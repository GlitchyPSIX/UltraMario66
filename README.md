# Usage
Use as a regular font. Here are some things to keep in consideration:
 * Some glyphs are missing. They will be added as they're needed and will be updated here. (You can contribute too!)
 * an Asterisk (*) will be the Star. A Dollar sign ($) will be a coin. An at-symbol (@) will be a silhouette of Mario's head.
